        <p>
          I graduated from my University with a bachelor's in Communication
          studies and am currently expanding my computer knowledge in a
          front-end web development program. I am an avid golfer, with 4 years
          of experience at D1 level, which has allowed me to develop strong work
          ethics and time management. My experience with hospitality includes
          fundraising, working at an Inn, and a golf pro shop. I have strong
          customer service relations experience and organizational skills needed
          for documenting and marketing.
